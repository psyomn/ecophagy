# psy-notes

This is a proof of concept for a very light notes server.

It is not recommend you use this on an actual server.

It is a toy, which was used to answer on how much I could get away with, using
minimal dependencies, to create a basic CRUD application.  The answer is quite,
however compounding features upon this would end up generating more headaches
than necessary.

Should support:
- individual users
- they can create their own notes (text blobs)
- they can toggle their notes viewable by
  - themselves (private)
  - anyone that accesses the site (public)
